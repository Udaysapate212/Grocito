# 🛒 Grocito – Fast-Track Grocery Delivery System

> 🚀 A real-time, location-based grocery delivery web application inspired by Blinkit, built by **Team Code2Cart**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**Grocito** is a full-stack grocery delivery platform that enables users to seamlessly browse, order, and track groceries in real-time based on their location. The system implements **role-based access control** (User, Admin, Delivery Partner), and intelligently manages **location-specific inventory** using pincode mapping.

Inspired by Blinkit, Grocito includes essential features such as product discovery, cart management, checkout, and delivery tracking—while also introducing innovative add-ons like smart suggestions, analytics, and instant checkout.
