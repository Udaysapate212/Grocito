# 🔐 Role-Based Product Management System - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

I have successfully implemented a **comprehensive role-based Product Management System** that respects admin hierarchy and pincode-based access control, working with **real-time data and real database integration**.

## 🏗️ Role Hierarchy Implementation

### **SUPER_ADMIN** 
- **Full Access**: Can manage products from **ALL pincodes**
- **Global View**: See analytics and inventory across all regions
- **No Restrictions**: Create, edit, delete products anywhere
- **Example Users**: `admin@grocito.com`

### **ADMIN (Regional Admin)**
- **Pincode-Restricted**: Can only manage products from their **assigned pincode**
- **Regional View**: See analytics only for their region
- **Limited Operations**: Create/edit/delete only within their pincode
- **Example Users**: 
  - `admin.south@grocito.com` (Pincode: 110001)
  - `admin.north@grocito.com` (Pincode: 110002)
  - `admin.pune@grocito.com` (Pincode: 412105)

## 🚀 Real-Time Features Implemented

### **Frontend Role-Based Controls**
✅ **Dynamic UI Adaptation**
- Header shows role-specific information
- Pincode field auto-populated and disabled for regional admins
- Action buttons (edit/delete) disabled for unauthorized products
- Stock editing restricted based on product pincode

✅ **Visual Access Indicators**
- "Your Region" badges for regional admin products
- "All Access" indicators for super admin
- Disabled buttons with permission tooltips
- Role-specific error messages

✅ **Real-Time Filtering**
- Super Admin: Sees all products from all pincodes
- Regional Admin: Automatically filtered to their pincode only
- Analytics dashboard shows role-appropriate data

### **Backend Role-Based Security**
✅ **API-Level Access Control**
- All CRUD operations check user permissions
- Role and pincode extracted from JWT tokens
- Forbidden (403) responses for unauthorized access
- Comprehensive logging of access attempts

✅ **Data Filtering**
- Products automatically filtered by pincode for regional admins
- Analytics calculated per region for regional admins
- Search and filter operations respect role boundaries

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Frontend Components Enhanced**
```javascript
// ProductManagement.js - Role-aware main component
- Loads products based on admin role and pincode
- Passes adminInfo to all child components
- Role-specific analytics loading

// ProductModal.js - Role-restricted form
- Auto-sets pincode for regional admins
- Disables pincode field for regional admins
- Validates pincode permissions

// ProductTable.js - Permission-aware actions
- Shows/hides edit/delete buttons based on permissions
- Disables stock editing for unauthorized products
- Visual indicators for access levels
```

### **Backend Security Enhanced**
```java
// ProductController.java - Complete role-based access control
- getUserRoleFromRequest() - Extracts role from JWT
- getUserPincodeFromRequest() - Extracts pincode from JWT
- hasProductAccess() - Validates product access permissions
- All endpoints protected with role checks
```

## 🧪 Testing the Role-Based System

### **Test Scenario 1: Super Admin Access**
```bash
# Login as Super Admin
POST /api/users/login
{
  "email": "admin@grocito.com",
  "password": "admin123"
}

# Result: Can see and manage ALL products from ALL pincodes
GET /api/products → Returns products from 110001, 110002, 412105, etc.
```

### **Test Scenario 2: Regional Admin Access**
```bash
# Login as South Delhi Admin
POST /api/users/login
{
  "email": "admin.south@grocito.com", 
  "password": "admin123"
}

# Result: Can only see products from pincode 110001
GET /api/products → Returns only products with pincode: 110001
```

### **Test Scenario 3: Unauthorized Access Attempt**
```bash
# Regional Admin tries to edit product from different pincode
PUT /api/products/123 (product has pincode 110002)
Authorization: Bearer [regional-admin-token-110001]

# Result: 403 Forbidden
{
  "error": "Access denied. You can only update products from your assigned region."
}
```

## 🎮 How to Test Live

### **Step 1: Start the System**
```bash
# Backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Frontend Admin Portal
cd grocito-frontend-admin
npm start
```

### **Step 2: Test Different Admin Roles**

**Super Admin Test:**
1. Login: `admin@grocito.com` / `admin123`
2. Navigate to Products → See ALL products
3. Try editing any product → Should work
4. Check analytics → Shows global data

**Regional Admin Test:**
1. Login: `admin.south@grocito.com` / `admin123`
2. Navigate to Products → See only pincode 110001 products
3. Try editing product from 110001 → Should work
4. Try editing product from 110002 → Buttons disabled
5. Add new product → Pincode auto-set to 110001

### **Step 3: Verify Real-Time Restrictions**

**Product Creation:**
- Regional admin can only create products for their pincode
- Pincode field is disabled and pre-filled
- Validation prevents pincode changes

**Product Editing:**
- Edit buttons disabled for products outside admin's region
- Stock editing restricted to authorized products
- Error messages show specific permission issues

**Analytics Dashboard:**
- Super admin sees global statistics
- Regional admin sees region-specific data
- Product counts and categories filtered by access level

## 📊 Real-Time Data Flow

### **Login Process**
1. User logs in with email/password
2. Backend validates credentials
3. JWT token generated with role and pincode
4. Frontend stores user info and role data
5. All subsequent API calls include role context

### **Product Loading Process**
1. Frontend determines user role (SUPER_ADMIN vs ADMIN)
2. API call includes role context in headers
3. Backend extracts role and pincode from token
4. Products filtered based on permissions
5. Frontend receives role-appropriate data

### **Permission Validation Process**
1. User attempts product operation (edit/delete/stock update)
2. Frontend checks local permissions (UI level)
3. API call sent with authorization header
4. Backend validates product access permissions
5. Operation allowed/denied based on role and pincode match

## 🔒 Security Features

### **Multi-Layer Security**
- **Frontend Validation**: UI restrictions and visual feedback
- **API-Level Security**: Server-side permission checks
- **Data Filtering**: Database queries respect role boundaries
- **Audit Logging**: All access attempts logged with role context

### **Permission Matrix**
| Operation | Super Admin | Regional Admin (Own Pincode) | Regional Admin (Other Pincode) |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| View Products | ✅ All | ✅ Own Region | ❌ Filtered Out |
| Create Product | ✅ Any Pincode | ✅ Own Pincode Only | ❌ Forbidden |
| Edit Product | ✅ Any Product | ✅ Own Region Only | ❌ Forbidden |
| Delete Product | ✅ Any Product | ✅ Own Region Only | ❌ Forbidden |
| Update Stock | ✅ Any Product | ✅ Own Region Only | ❌ Forbidden |
| View Analytics | ✅ Global Data | ✅ Regional Data | ❌ No Access |
